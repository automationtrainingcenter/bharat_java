package inheritance;
/*
    Inheritance means achieving or acquiring the properties and behaviour of one class (Parent or Super or Base) in
    another class (Child or Sub).
    To Create one class as parent to another class we have to use "extends" keyword.

    syntax:
    public class Child extends Parent{ }

    class A {
        methodOne() { }
    }

    A a = new A();
    a.methodOne();

    class B extends A{
        methodTwo() { }
    }

    B b = new B();
    b.methodTwo();
    b.methodOne();

    Whenever we are creating child class object, that child class object can access child class methods and also
    it's parent class methods.

    Note: we can't access Parent class private properties or methods using child class objects or Child class
    can't inherit Parent class private properties and methods.
